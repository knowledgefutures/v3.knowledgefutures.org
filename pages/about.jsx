				<h1>Our story</h1>

				<p className={styles.fullPanelP}>
					Knowledge Futures is an independent nonprofit organization powered by
					academic, industry, and advocacy groups. Together we build and support products
					and protocols to make knowledge open and accessible to all.
				</p>
				<div className={styles.panels}>
					<div>
						<p>
							Founded in 2018 as a partnership between the MIT Press and the MIT Media
							Lab, Knowledge Futures was created to build sustainable tools and
							technologies for libraries, presses, museums, activist organizations,
							researchers, and others whose knowledge work seeks to serve collective
							understanding and the public. What began as a handful of grad students
							working on publishing tools grew to an organization focused on
							addressing the systemic challenges faced by public-oriented groups
							beholden to infrastructure that is designed with misaligned incentives
							and unjust power dynamics.
						</p>
						<p>
							In September 2019 we formally organized as an independent 501c3
							nonprofit. Today, we are committed to building a full-stack of
							technology protocols and products that demonstrate an effective,
							equitable, and sustainable knowledge economy is possible. We work with
							partners to design for interoperability and to catalyze a distributed
							ecosystem of development.

				<h1>How we work</h1>
				<div className={styles.panels}>
					<div>
						<p>
							Knowledge Futures is guided by a set of values that drive and
							focus the work we do. From hiring, to product development, to day-to-day
							interpersonal relationships, these values serve as the ground truth for
							how we work.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Accessibility</b>: We believe that just because knowledge is
							available doesn’t mean it’s truly accessible. We put ourselves in
							others’ positions to understand the barriers that prevent knowledge from
							being truly accessible to diverse groups around the world.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Conscientiousness</b>: We value honesty and good-faith efforts to
							fulfill our duties and obligations as highly as success in its own
							right.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Curiosity</b>: We approach challenges with an honest, experimental,
							problem-solving mindset. We bring an intellectual curiosity that
							explores problem spaces with openness and intrigue in ways that lead to
							important new ideas.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Egalitarianism</b>: We acknowledges that all people deserve equality
							and fairness regardless of the individual circumstances of their life.
							We recognize that teams, especially distributed ones, are made of people
							who bring different perspectives, opportunities, and cultures that add
							to the strength of the team.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Systemic outlook</b>: We prioritize solutions that tackle problems in
							systemic ways rather than iterating solely at the margins. We think
							systematically when we approach problems, rather than solely thinking
							locally.
						</p>

						<p>
							<b>Sustainability</b>: We value solutions that are sustainable and
							durable for the long-term, even if they’re more difficult, over ones
							that are more expedient but less sustainable.
						</p>
